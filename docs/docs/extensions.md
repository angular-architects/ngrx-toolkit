The NgRx Toolkit is a set of extensions to the NgRx SignalsStore.

It offers extensions like:

- [⭐️ Devtools](./with-devtools): Integration into Redux Devtools
- [Redux](./with-redux): Possibility to use the Redux Pattern (Reducer, Actions, Effects)
- [DataService](./with-data-service): Builds on top of `withEntities` and adds the backend synchronization to it
- [Storage Sync](./with-storage-sync): Synchronizes the Store with Web Storage
- [Undo Redo](./with-undo-redo): Adds Undo/Redo functionality to your store
- [Reset](./with-reset): Adds a `resetState` method to your store
- [State Immutability Protection](./with-immutable-state): Protects the state from being mutated outside or inside the Store.

To install it, run

```shell
npm i @angular-architects/ngrx-toolkit
```
