title: withDevtools()

```typescript
import { withDevtools } from '@angular-architects/ngrx-toolkit';
```

Redux Devtools is a powerful browser extension tool, that allows you to inspect every change in your stores. Originally, it was designed for Redux, but it can also be used with the SignalStore. You can download it for Chrome [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd).

To use the Devtools, you need to add the `withDevtools()` extension to your SignalStore:

```typescript
import { withDevtools } from '@angular-architects/ngrx-toolkit';

export const FlightStore = signalStore(
  { providedIn: 'root' },
  withDevtools('flights'), // <-- add this
  withState({ flights: [] as Flight[] }),
  // ...
);
```

After that, open your app and navigate to the component that uses the store. Open the Devtools and you will see the `flights` store in the Devtools under the name "NgRx Signal Store"

You can find a working example in the [demo app](https://github.com/angular-architects/ngrx-toolkit/blob/main/apps/demo/src/app/devtools/todo-store.ts).

:::info
The extensions don't activate during app initialization (as it is with `@ngrx/store`). You need to open the Devtools and select the "NgRx Signal Store" tab to activate them.

## `updateState()` vs `patchState()`

```typescript
import { updateState } from '@angular-architects/ngrx-toolkit';
```

The Signal Store does not use the Redux pattern, so there are no action names involved by default. Instead, every action is referred to as a "Store Update". If you want to customize the action name for better clarity, you can use the `updateState()` function instead of `patchState()`:

```typescript
import { updateState } from '@angular-architects/ngrx-toolkit';

patchState(this.store, { loading: false });

// updateState is a wrapper around patchState and has an action name as second parameter
updateState(this.store, 'update loading', { loading: false });
```

## `renameDevtoolsName()`

```typescript
import { renameDevtoolsName } from '@angular-architects/ngrx-toolkit';
```

If multiple instances of a given SignalStore exist, the Devtools will index the names. For example, if you have two `TodoDetail` instances with the name `todo-detail`, the first one will be named `todo-detail` and the second one `todo-detail-1`.

At any time, you can use `renameDevtoolsName()` to change the name of the store in the Devtools.

The following example shows a component, which has a locally provided store and renames it according to the `id` of the `todo` Signal.

```typescript
import { renameDevtoolsName, withDevtools } from '@angular-architects/ngrx-toolkit';

const TodoDetailStore = signalStore(withDevtools('todo-detail'), withState({ id: 1 }));

@Component({
  // ...
  providers: [TodoDetailStore],
})
export class TodoDetailComponent {
  readonly #todoDetailStore = inject(TodoDetailStore);
  todo = input.required<Todo>();

  constructor() {
    effect(() => {
      renameDevtoolsName(this.#todoDetailStore, `todo-${this.todo().id}`);
    });
  }
}
```

## `withGlitchTracking()`

```typescript
import { withGlitchTracking } from '@angular-architects/ngrx-toolkit';
```

It tracks all state changes of the State, including intermediary updates
that are typically suppressed by Angular's glitch-free mechanism.

This feature is especially useful for debugging.

Example:

```typescript
import { withGlitchTracking, withDevtools } from '@angular-architects/ngrx-toolkit';

const Store = signalStore(
  { providedIn: 'root' },
  withState({ count: 0 }),
  withDevtools('counter', withGlitchTracking()),
  withMethods((store) => ({
    increase: () => patchState(store, (value) => ({ count: value.count + 1 })),
  })),
);

// would show up in the DevTools with value 0
const store = inject(Store);

store.increase(); // would show up in the DevTools with value 1
store.increase(); // would show up in the DevTools with value 2
store.increase(); // would show up in the DevTools with value 3
```

Without `withGlitchTracking()`, the DevTools would only show the final value of 3.

It is also possible to mix. So one store could have `withGlitchTracking()` and another one not.

## `withDisabledNameIndices()`

```typescript
import { withDisabledNameIndices } from '@angular-architects/ngrx-toolkit';
```

`withDevtools()` foresees the possibility to add features which extend or modify it. At the moment, `withDisabledNameIndices()` is the only feature available. It disables the automatic indexing of the store names in the Devtools.

If multiple instances exist at the same time, `withDisabledNameIndices()` will throw an error. This is useful if you want to ensure that only one instance of a store is active at a time or that the store name is unique.

You activate per store:

```typescript
import { withDisabledNameIndices, withDevtools } from '@angular-architects/ngrx-toolkit';

const Store = signalStore({ providedIn: 'root' }, withDevtools('flights', withDisabledNameIndices()), withState({ airline: 'Lufthansa' }));
```

## `withMapper()`

```typescript
import { withMapper } from '@angular-architects/ngrx-toolkit';
```

`withMapper()` allows you to define a function that maps the state before it is sent to the Devtools.

Sometimes, it is necessary to map the state before it is sent to the Devtools. For example, you might want to exclude some properties, like passwords or other sensitive data.

```typescript
import { withMapper, withDevtools } from '@angular-architects/ngrx-toolkit';

const initialState = {
  id: 1,
  email: 'john.list@host.com',
  name: 'John List',
  enteredPassword: '',
};

const Store = signalStore(
  withState(initialState),
  withDevtools(
    'user',
    withMapper((state) => ({ ...state, enteredPassword: '***' })),
  ),
);
```

## Disabling Devtools in production

`withDevtools()` is by default enabled in production mode, if you want to tree-shake it from the application bundle you need to abstract it in your environment file.

It is required to add the `withDevtools()` function to the environment files.

environments/environment.ts:

```typescript
import { withDevtools } from '@angular-architects/ngrx-toolkit';

export const environment = {
  storeWithDevTools: withDevtools,
};
```

environments/environment.prod.ts

```typescript
import { withDevtoolsStub } from '@angular-architects/ngrx-toolkit';

export const environment = {
  storeWithDevTools: withDevToolsStub,
};
```

Then you can create utility function which can be used across the application
e.g.:

shared/store.features.ts (or any other file)

```typescript
import { environment } from 'src/environments/environment';

export const withTreeShakableDevTools = environment.storeWithDevTools;
```

And use it in your store definitions:

```typescript
export const SomeStore = signalStore(withState({ strings: [] as string[] }), withTreeShakableDevTools('featureName'));
```

Also make sure you have defined file replacements in angular.json prod configuration:

```json
{
  "fileReplacements": [
    {
      "replace": "src/environments/environment.ts",
      "with": "src/environments/environment.prod.ts"
    }
  ]
}
```
