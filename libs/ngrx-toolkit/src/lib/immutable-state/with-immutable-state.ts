/**
 * The implementation of this feature is a little bit tricky.
 *
 * `signalStore` does a shallow clone in the initial phase, in order to
 * merge all different states together.
 *
 * Shallow cloning also happens in `patchState`.
 *
 * With shallow cloning, the root state object is replaced, which means,
 * the freezing only stays for its nested properties but not for
 * the primitive and immediate properties.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const state = {
 *   id: 1,
 *   address: {
 *     street: 'Main St',
 *     city: 'Springfield',
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Running `Object.freeze` on `state` will freeze the `address` object, and
 * the `id`. But since `state` is shallow cloned, the "frozing" state of the
 * `id` is lost. `address`, being an object, is still frozen.
 *
 * To overcome that, we run `watchState` and run `deepFreeze`
 * on every change.
